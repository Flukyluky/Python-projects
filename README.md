# Python-projects
These are just some small personal projects to help improve my python skills and hopefully lead on to bigger projects down the line. 
This might not start off very splashy or innovative but I just want to accumulate more knowledge and skill. As I go, the projects will get more complex and robust but it is all part of the process.
